  <a href='https://github.com/defucilis/funscript-io'>Funscript.io</a> - Create, Modify, Enjoy Funscripts
</h1>

*Funscript.io is kind of meant to be a one-stop-shop for a variety of funscript-related tasks. It features an easy-to-use, fully-featured script player, funscript tweaking and modification tools, as well as some interesting new ways to control your Handy!*

*I‚Äôve been tinkering with and using the site for ages, adding new features every so-often, and I think it‚Äôs is at a point now where it might be useful for other people. I add new features all the time, so check back here every once-in-a-while to see what new stuff I‚Äôve added!*
