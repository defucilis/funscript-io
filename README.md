# Funscript.io

Hello! If you're here, you're a little early. Right now, funscript.io is a personal project that I'm not really talking about. For now, it's just for my use, but feel free to go try it out. The site is live at [https://funscript.io](https://funscript.io).

There are a few broad categories of things that I want to do with the site:

1. Allow people to play scripts locally - kind of like HandyFeeling, but a little more reliable and feature-rich (actually, the main reason I started this whole project was because I wanted to be able to change sync offset with the arrow keys haha)
2. Control the Handy manually, with many more features than the basic "increase/decrease stroke length, increase/decrease speed" options.
3. Fine-tune and modify funscripts - things like offsetting the entire script's start time, halving/doubling the speed, remapping stroke length, etc.
4. Find more great funscripts! I might even end up combining funscript.io and scriptaxis.com for this purpose...
